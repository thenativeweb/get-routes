# get-routes

get-routes gets all routes from an Express or Sails.js application.

## Installation

```shell
$ npm install get-routes
```

## Quick start

First you need to integrate get-routes into your application.

```javascript
const getRoutes = require('get-routes');
```

Then, call `getRoutes` with an Express or a Sails.js app to get a list of all registered routes.

```javascript
const routes = getRoutes(app);

console.log(routes);
// => {
//      get: [
//        '/articles'
//      ],
//      post: [
//        '/articles/:id'
//      ],
//      ...
//    }
```
